- open library from archive.org (the internet archive) is rad
- can't use [FastMCP](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp/) because it doesn't support resources
- set up a cloudflare tunnel from <subdomain>.tomelliot.net -> local server for dev
- need to have 2 servers (& therefore 2 tunnel subdomains): one hosts the MCP server, the second hosts the assets for the components
